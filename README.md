# Build a Laravel-powered Site

This project is a web application for a Pet Adoption site built using Laravel. The main (index) page displays a featured pet banner followed by images of both dogs and cats. Each pet entry uses the Unsplash Source API to generate dog and cat images.

## Instillation

Then run command ```php artisan serve --host=localhost```. This will start the local server at port 8000.

Navigate to ```localhost:8000``` to view the site.
